                <div class="text-center text-slate-500 mt-8 mx-4" style="width: 650px;">US citizens are making an effort to limit their sugar intake, recognizing the health benefits of a balanced diet. From sugar substitutes to mindful snacking, these healthier choices are becoming a priority for many. </div>

                <div class="text-center text-slate-500 mt-8 mx-4" style="width: 650px;">US citizens reject the notion that limiting sugar intake should require strict diets. Instead, they advocate for moderation and balance, enjoying sugary treats in moderation. </div>

                        <span class="font-bold text-black">About Chart: </span> The parrallel coordinates chart explains the relationship between sugar consumption and education level by categorising it in the data from 3 different states. One can also depict the habit of number of times sugar consumption per day througout the lifespan of a person. 
                    </p>

                        <span class="font-bold text-black">Narration: </span> The goal of this chart is to illustrate how a person's sugar consumption habits change over time. By looking at the chart we can see that in each listed state (Vermont, Connecticut and New York), the number of times a person consumes sugar per day decreases overall as they age. It can be also said that as the consumption deacreases, residents became more aware of the health risks associated with sugar consumption. Hence, it supports the viewpoint that citizens do care about their sugar consumption.

                                Using this technique data is being represented in a way that it shows the individual behaviour of an average person from the listed states. This is framed this way because a viewer can easily relate to the narration and can easily understand the behaviour of the person, which is highly effective.

                                This technique is used in categorising different states using different colors. Because of this, a user can easily compare the data from different states and can easily understand the behaviour of the people from different states.

                                The different axis which shows phases of a person, implemnets this technique. This technique increases engagement of the user because a viewer can put attention to the ups and downs throughout the lifespan of a person.

                        <span class="font-bold text-black">About Chart: </span> The radar chart also explains the relationship between sugar consumption and education level by categorising it in the data from 3 different states. However, it displays the data from the states whoes residents have higher number consumptions of sugar producs per day as compared to other state residents.

                        <span class="font-bold text-black">Narration: </span> The goal of this chart is to show on what phase of life a person consumes the most sugar. By looking at the chart we can see that in each listed state (Kentucky, Louisiana, West Virginia), the number of times a person consumes sugar per day is highest when a person is middle school. And over time it deacreases but not in deep level, as it still covers most of the area on radar chart. This behaviour shows that the citizens are less aware of the health risks, which means they don't really care about their sugar consumption, opposing the viewpoint.

                                This technique is used in this chart by not showing the data of the states whoes residents have lower number consumptions of sugar producs per day as compared to other state residents. Because of this, a viewer can put attention to the data of the states whoes residents have higher number consumptions of sugar.

                                We group the data of same states and categorise them using different colors. The legend around the radar circle are also classified using same font and style which makes it easy for a viewer to understand the data an highlight how much a an average person from a state covers the radar chart on which phase of life.
                            </li>

                                For this radar chart, a subgroup of data was created and binned from the large dataset who has the data from all states. This is because using this rhetoric technique I wanted to focus on the states whoes residents have higher number consumptions of sugar producs per day as compared to other state residents.
                            </li>
